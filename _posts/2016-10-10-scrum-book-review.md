For the last two weeks I've been working as a full-time web developer. Four months after graduating [Firehose](http://www.thefirehoseproject.com), the efforts I've put into becoming a developer have finally paid off. During this time, I've applied to 58 job postings and went to 8 face-to-face interviews, and this has been the first job offer. I was hired as a PHP developer. This was very unexpected and incredibly lucky, to say the least, since PHP was not one of the languages I knew well, and said so at the interview. This turned out not to be a problem because they were not looking for someone who already knows PHP. Instead, they were looking for someone experienced in web development using any other MVC framework, who could be trained to use a PHP framework. (I'm guessing its more cost-efficient to hire an entry-level developer and train them, instead of hiring someone more experienced at a higher salary.) My Firehose experience with Rails was a good fit. Another helpful factor was that I did know the fundamentals of PHP. This was something I picked up while working on an open-source application that was meant to help refugees in Europe find housing. Shortly after that, the group I was working with ([Prosper](http://prosper.community), led by the Firehose grad [John Ellison](https://uk.linkedin.com/in/jbellison)) changed direction and the PHP application that I started working on was set aside. But, the knowledge of PHP stayed. These two factors resulted in an an interview, which led to a job offer.
